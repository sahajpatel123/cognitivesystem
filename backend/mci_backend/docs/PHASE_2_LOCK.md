# Phase 2 Lock

This document locks Phase 2 (Minimal Correct Implementation) permanently.

## 1. Lock Declaration

- **PHASE 2 IS LOCKED.**

## 2. Meaning of "Locked"

When Phase 2 is locked:

- No code changes are allowed to the MCI implementation.
- No prompt changes are allowed.
- No memory rule changes are allowed.
- No reasoning behavior changes are allowed.
- No expression behavior changes are allowed.
- No observability expansion is allowed beyond what is already defined.
- No reinterpretation of existing tests or invariants is allowed.

## 3. Read-Only Rule

- Phase 2 files are **read-only** except for archival or purely formatting-related fixes that do not alter behavior or meaning.
- Any change that affects behavior, semantics, or claims invalidates the lock.

There are no exceptions, escape hatches, or conditional relaxations of this lock.
