# Phase 2 Certification

This document certifies that Phase 2 (Minimal Correct Implementation) is complete.

## 1. Phase 2 Completion

- Phase 2 objectives are fully met.
- All planned steps in Phase 2 have been executed and closed.

Completed steps:

- **STEP A** — Formal Cognitive Contract
- **STEP B** — Minimal Correct Implementation (MCI)
- **STEP C** — Observability and Debugging Guarantees
- **STEP D** — Contract Conformance and Failure Testing
- **STEP E** — Deterministic Reference Wiring
- **STEP F** — Phase Lock and Certification Boundary

## 2. MCI Status

The Minimal Correct Implementation (MCI):

- Is **minimal**: it implements only what the Cognitive Contract requires.
- Is **correct**: it enforces contract rules and fails on violations.
- Is **deterministic**: given the same inputs, it follows the same execution path and produces the same outputs.
- Is **contract-conformant**: it respects the Cognitive Contract as implemented.
- Is **executable**: it can run end-to-end through the reference entry point.

## 3. Reference Implementation Declaration

- The MCI is a **reference implementation**, not a product.
- It is intended as a correctness baseline and certification artifact.
- It is not designed or certified for performance, user experience, or deployment as a production system.
