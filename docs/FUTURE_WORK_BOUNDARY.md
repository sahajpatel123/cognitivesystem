# Future Work Boundary

This document defines how future ideas must be handled relative to this program.

## 1. Ideas That Cannot Be Added to This Program

The following types of ideas cannot be added within this program:

- Memory beyond current session behavior.
- Personalization based on user or organization identity.
- Learning from individual users or groups.
- Adaptation of behavior or style to specific users or teams.
- Changes to cognitive contracts, prompts, planner behavior, hypothesis rules, or memory rules.

These ideas belong outside the scope of this closed program.

## 2. Requirements for Future Ideas

- Any future idea that changes how the system behaves, remembers, or is described requires:
  - A new program charter.
  - A new governance process.
  - A separate evaluation and certification lifecycle.

Future ideas must not be treated as extensions of this program.

## 3. Separation Between This System and Hypothetical Future Systems

- **This system**
  - Is defined by the existing Cognitive Contract, Governance Charter, and associated documents.
  - Operates under the steady-state operation rules defined for this program.
- **Any hypothetical future system**
  - Is outside the scope of this program.
  - Must be treated as a distinct effort with its own design, governance, and certification.

This boundary is intended to prevent mixing future concepts with the closed scope of this program.
