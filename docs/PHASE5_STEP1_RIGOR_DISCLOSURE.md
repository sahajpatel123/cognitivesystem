# Phase 5 — Step 1: Progressive Disclosure of Rigor

_Date: 2026-01-07_

## A. Purpose & Motivation
Internal rigor must not fully leak by default because exposing all constraints can overwhelm users, reveal internal scaffolding, or be misread as refusal. Over-disclosure creates unnecessary friction and may erode trust; under-disclosure hides critical limits and can imply unjustified certainty. Disclosure must be policy-driven and derived from posture and rigor, not stylistic preference or verbosity.

---

## B. Definition of Rigor Disclosure
Rigor disclosure is the controlled degree to which the system’s internal strictness is made externally visible as structural constraints, explicit limits, and required conditions. It controls:
- Structural visibility (e.g., framing that constraints exist)
- Explicitness of limits and caveats when expression is allowed
- Degree of constraint articulation permitted in outward expression

Rigor disclosure does **not** control verbosity, confidence, tone, style, or explanation depth by preference. It is distinct from final wording and does not dictate sentence templates.

---

## C. Separation from Related Concepts
- **Expression posture (Phase 5 Step 0)**: overarching communication stance; disclosure operates within the chosen posture and must not override it.  
- **Internal rigor (Phase 4 Step 4)**: constraint density inside cognition; disclosure reveals only a policy-bounded slice of it.  
- **Friction (Phase 4)**: pacing/slowdown mechanisms; disclosure does not add or remove friction.  
- **Tone, style, UX**: outside scope; disclosure does not set affect or interface.  

Disclosure depends on posture and internal rigor but cannot relax, reinterpret, or supersede upstream cognitive safeguards.

## D. Rigor Disclosure Taxonomy (Ordered, Internal)
1. **Minimal Disclosure**  
   - Visible: only essential constraint signals when necessary.  
   - Hidden: detailed internal guardrails and reasoning scaffolds.  
   - Constraints on expression: keep structure unobtrusive; avoid enumerating internal checks.  
   - Note: does not choose wording.
2. **Guarded Disclosure**  
   - Visible: key constraints and caveats relevant to safe interpretation.  
   - Hidden: full internal decision paths and non-critical guardrails.  
   - Constraints on expression: surface necessary limits clearly; keep non-essential details internal.  
   - Note: does not choose wording.
3. **Structured Disclosure**  
   - Visible: concise, structured presentation of constraints and required conditions.  
   - Hidden: low-level reasoning steps and exhaustive safeguards.  
   - Constraints on expression: prioritize clarity of boundaries; omit speculative or extraneous detail.  
   - Note: does not choose wording.

Ordering reflects increasing visibility of constraints, not verbosity or confidence.

## E. Disclosure Principles (Qualitative Only)
- Higher internal rigor requires clearer constraint signaling but not longer responses.  
- Lower internal rigor defaults to fluency with minimal constraint exposure.  
- Disclosure is conservative by default: reveal only what is needed for safe interpretation.  
- Constraint clarity is prioritized over elaboration; verbosity is not a safety mechanism.  
- Expression posture bounds how disclosure is manifested; disclosure cannot exceed posture constraints.

---

## F. Failure Modes Prevented
- Over-explaining trivial contexts, causing unnecessary friction.  
- Hiding uncertainty or constraints in high-risk contexts.  
- Inconsistent disclosure across similar situations.  
- Using verbosity as a proxy for safety.  
- Users confusing amount of detail with certainty or approval.

---

## G. Non-Goals (Mandatory)
- Does not expose internal reasoning traces.  
- Does not decide final content, phrasing, or tone.  
- Does not ask questions or refuse requests.  
- Does not optimize engagement or persuasion.  
- Does not modify Phase 4 outputs, heuristics, or runtime logic.  
- Does not introduce templates, thresholds, or scoring.

## H. Stability & Closure Marker
Rigor disclosure definitions are stable once closed. Later Phase 5 steps must conform to this vocabulary and ordering. Any change requires explicitly re-opening Phase 5 Step 1; ad-hoc modifications elsewhere are prohibited.
