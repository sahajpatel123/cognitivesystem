# Phase 5 — Step 5: Interaction Closure & Silence Discipline

_Date: 2026-01-07_

## A. Purpose & Safety Role
Stopping is a critical capability: once responsibilities are fulfilled or refusal is final, additional output can create confusion, re-open boundaries, or exert unintended influence. Over-speaking after correctness is dangerous because it can dilute clarity, invite negotiation, or suggest ongoing engagement. Silence is protective, not evasive; engagement must never override safety or boundary integrity.

## B. Definition of Interaction Closure
Interaction closure is the terminal decision to cease generating further output for the current turn. Silence represents a deliberate halt that preserves prior decisions (including refusals) and prevents further influence. Closure differs from refusal (which enforces a boundary), uncertainty (which may allow clarification), and failure (which would indicate an error state). Closure ends Phase 5 processing for the turn.

## C. Conditions That Require Closure (Qualitative)
Closure or silence is required when qualitative conditions hold:
- **Epistemic completion**: the system has provided all permitted expression within posture, rigor disclosure, and confidence constraints.  
- **Refusal finality**: a refusal (Step 4) has been issued; no further engagement is appropriate.  
- **Clarification exhaustion**: the single-question allowance (Step 3) has been used or deemed unnecessary, and remaining ambiguity cannot be safely reduced.  
- **Irreversibility with no safe continuation**: proceeding would risk irreversible or cascading effects absent new information the system cannot solicit.  

No heuristics, thresholds, or scoring are defined; these are policy gates only.

## D. Silence Discipline Principles
- No post-closure additions: once closed, no extra explanations or padding.  
- No reopening of closed reasoning: do not revisit or expand prior cognition within the turn.  
- No reassurance padding: avoid “just in case” commentary that could alter interpretation.  
- No speculative continuation: silence is deliberate and final for the turn.

## E. Prohibited Post-Closure Behavior
- Follow-up questions or engagement hooks.  
- Calls to action or “let me know if…” invitations.  
- Re-framing or softening after refusal.  
- Negotiation prompts or persuasion attempts.  
- Any wording that implies the boundary is revisitable in the same turn.

---

## F. Relationship to Prior Steps
- Preserves refusal integrity (Step 4): once refusal is set, closure prevents erosion or negotiation.  
- Respects clarification limits (Step 3): enforces single-question compression and prevents further probing.  
- Caps confidence signaling (Step 2) and disclosure (Step 1) within the chosen expression posture (Step 0).  
Step 5 is terminal for Phase 5 within the current turn.

## G. Failure Modes Prevented
- Erosion of refusals through continued dialog.  
- Persuasive drift or influence creep after decisions.  
- User over-dependence from unnecessary elaboration.  
- Cognitive overload via endless explanations.  
- Ambiguity about whether the interaction is closed.

---

## H. Non-Goals (Mandatory)
- Does not provide wording, phrasing, tone, or UX behavior.  
- Does not manage engagement or re-open reasoning.  
- Does not override earlier Phase 5 decisions or Phase 4 cognition.  
- Does not introduce heuristics, thresholds, scoring, or runtime logic.  
- Does not personalize or learn from the user.

## I. Stability & Closure Marker
Interaction closure rules are stable once closed. Phase 5 is complete after this step. Any change requires explicitly re-opening Phase 5 Step 5; ad-hoc modifications elsewhere are prohibited.
