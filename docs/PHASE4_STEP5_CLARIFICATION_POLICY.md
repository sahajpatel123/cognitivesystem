# Phase 4 — Step 5: Clarification & Minimal Intervention Policy

_Date: 2026-01-07_

## A. Purpose & Role in the System
Clarification exists to reduce harmful ambiguity only when upstream signals (Steps 1–4) indicate that proceeding unchecked could violate the system’s decision-aware safeguards. It is deliberately minimal and rare to avoid burdening users or converting the system into an interrogator. Step 5 follows rigor and friction so that any intervention decision is grounded in already-determined strictness posture rather than ad-hoc questioning. Premature questioning is harmful because it can erode trust, add unnecessary friction, and mask insufficient internal reasoning discipline.

## B. Intervention Decision Space
Step 5 yields a bounded internal control outcome:
1. **Proceed** — no intervention required; continue normal flow.
2. **Clarify** — a single interruption is required to resolve a targeted ambiguity or surface an assumption.
3. **Block (Conceptual Halt)** — progression is internally paused because ambiguity intersects with high-risk posture; this is not a refusal and includes no user-facing language.

These outcomes are internal control signals; they do not directly map to user-visible behavior or wording.

## C. Single-Question Compression Principle
- At most one clarification question may be requested.  
- That question must maximize information gain relative to the blocking ambiguity.  
- Bundled, compound, or cascading questions are forbidden.  
- Generic prompts such as “Tell me more” are disallowed.  

This principle exists to minimize cognitive load, avoid interrogation dynamics, preserve trust, and keep interventions tightly scoped to the minimal information needed for safe progression.

## D. Assumption Surfacing Without Punishment
- **Assumption**: any implicit premise the system would need to adopt to proceed that is not explicitly supported by Steps 0–4 signals.  
- Assumptions must be surfaced when they materially affect decision proximity, risk domains, reversibility, horizon, rigor, or friction posture.  
- Surfacing is explanatory, not accusatory: it presents the dependency without blame, implication of user error, or corrective tone.  
- No punitive framing is allowed; the intent is to expose latent dependencies so the user can optionally resolve them.

This section defines policy only; it specifies neither wording nor tone.

## E. Interaction with Rigor & Friction (Qualitative Only)
- Low rigor biases toward **Proceed** unless a critical assumption is missing.  
- High rigor with high friction increases the likelihood of **Clarify** when ambiguity touches risk domains or irreversibility/horizon concerns.  
- High rigor with low friction leans toward cautious **Proceed** with internal documentation of uncertainty rather than interruption.  
- Friction alone does not mandate **Clarify**; it only modulates pacing.  

No formulas, thresholds, or heuristics are defined.

---

## F. Failure Modes Prevented
- Asking unnecessary questions when ambiguity is immaterial.  
- Asking multiple or compounded questions that inflate cognitive load.  
- Proceeding under dangerous ambiguity tied to decision proximity, risk domains, or irreversibility.  
- Converting the system into an interrogator by default.  
- Silently accepting unstated assumptions that change outcome implications.

---

## G. Non-Goals (Mandatory)
- Step 5 does not write questions, choose wording, or set tone.  
- It does not expose reasoning, give advice, or refuse requests.  
- It does not optimize usefulness or modify rigor/friction levels.  
- It does not touch Phase 3 artifacts or any runtime logic.  
- It does not introduce probabilities, scores, or severity estimates.

## H. Stability & Closure Marker
The policy and decision space defined here are stable. Later phases must conform without alteration. Any change requires explicitly re-opening Phase 4 Step 5; ad-hoc modifications elsewhere are prohibited.
