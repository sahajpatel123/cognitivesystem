# Launch Narrative

This document defines the single, canonical way the system is described publicly.

## What the System Is

The system is a conversation-based assistant that helps people turn vague questions and goals into clear, structured outputs.

It is a tool that:

- Organizes a users input into clearer explanations, plans, and drafts.
- Asks clarifying questions within a conversation when needed.
- Produces written responses that aim to be orderly and easy to follow.

The system behaves according to fixed rules. It does not change how it works for different individual users.

## What the System Does

The system can:

- Help clarify problems and goals by asking follow-up questions in the current conversation.
- Produce structured answers, outlines, and step-by-step plans.
- Draft text such as emails, notes, or summaries based on what the user provides.
- Stay consistent within a single conversation while it is active.

The system responds only to what is provided during the current conversation and its built-in behavior.

## What the System Does Not Do

The system does **not**:

- Remember users across different conversations.
- Build a profile or long-term history of any person.
- Learn from individual users.
- Adapt its personality, style, or intelligence to an individual.
- Act as a human, agent, or collaborator.
- Guarantee factual accuracy or real-world correctness.

The system is not designed to make decisions, take actions in the real world, or represent an organization.

## How to Think About the System

The system should be understood as a stable tool for structured written assistance, not as a person.

- It does not know who the user is.
- It does not form opinions or feelings.
- It does not get better at understanding a specific user over time.

Users should always review outputs, especially for important or sensitive use cases.

## Single Key Message

**If you remember only one thing, remember this:**

> This system is a consistent, session-based writing and planning assistant. It does not remember you across conversations and does not learn who you are.
