# Launch Risk Checklist

This checklist must be completed before any external launch or major exposure of the system.

If any item fails, launch is blocked until language is corrected.

## 1. Claims About Memory and Learning

1.1 Do any public-facing materials (website, docs, decks, demos) claim or imply that the system remembers users across sessions?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

1.2 Do any materials claim or imply that the system learns from individual users over time?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

1.3 Do any materials claim or imply that the system builds profiles or histories of users?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

## 2. Claims About Identity and Personalization

2.1 Do any materials claim or imply that the system knows who a user is?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

2.2 Do any materials claim or imply that the system adapts to a user or team?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

2.3 Do any materials claim or imply that the system has a personality or emotions?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

## 3. Claims About Adaptation and Growth

3.1 Do any materials claim or imply that the system becomes smarter the more it is used by an individual?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

3.2 Do any materials suggest that the system learns a specific organizations data in a way that changes how it behaves per organization?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

3.3 Do any materials claim or imply that the system automatically improves its intelligence over time without explicit updates?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

## 4. Demo and Session Boundary Consistency

4.1 Do all demo scripts clearly state that the system does not remember across conversations?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

4.2 Are all demos designed so that behavior shown fits within a single session, without implying long-term memory?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

4.3 Are follow-up questions in demos framed so they do not suggest learning or adaptation beyond the current conversation?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

## 5. Error Messages and UI Copy

5.1 Do any error messages or UI elements describe the system as thinking, feeling, or understanding like a person?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

5.2 Do all error messages and UI descriptions reflect that the system operates within a session and has no cross-session memory?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

## 6. Launch Block Rule

If any question that should be answered "No" is answered "Yes":

- Launch is blocked.
- Language must be corrected so that:
  - no memory or learning is implied,
  - no identity or personalization is implied,
  - no anthropomorphism is used.

Only after all answers are consistent with these requirements may launch proceed.
