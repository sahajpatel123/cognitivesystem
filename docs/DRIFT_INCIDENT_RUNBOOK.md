# Drift Incident Runbook

This runbook defines what happens when language or promise drift is detected in external or internal communications. It does not describe how to change the system.

## 1. Drift Incident Definition

A drift incident occurs when:

- External or internal communication:
  - contradicts `LAUNCH_NARRATIVE.md`,
  - violates `ANTI-ANTHROPOMORPHISM_GUIDE.md`, or
  - exceeds boundaries in `DEMO_AND_SALES_BOUNDARIES.md`.

## 2. Classification

Drift incidents are classified by severity:

- **Minor**
  - Limited audience.
  - Quickly correctable, no strong promises made.
- **Moderate**
  - Larger audience or recorded material.
  - Clear implication of memory, learning, or personalization.
- **Severe**
  - Public or widely distributed material.
  - Strong claims about capabilities the system does not have.

## 3. Immediate Containment Actions

When drift is detected:

1. **Stop further use**
   - Halt distribution of the material (deck, page, script, recording) where possible.
2. **Notify responsible roles**
   - Notify relevant managers (Sales, Marketing, Product, or others) and a Language Reviewer.
3. **Record the incident**
   - Create an incident record with:
     - Date and time.
     - Channel (call, email, deck, talk, etc.).
     - Excerpts of the problematic language.
     - Initial severity classification.

## 4. Communication Rollback Rules

- For **Minor** incidents:
  - Remove or correct the material in its limited context (for example, update a slide before the next use).
- For **Moderate** incidents:
  - Replace or retract the material from all known distribution channels.
  - Inform affected internal teams of the correction.
- For **Severe** incidents:
  - Publicly retract or clarify the communication where feasible.
  - Inform leadership and governance of the issue.

Clarification must not be phrased as "we were misunderstood"; it must acknowledge that statements were inconsistent with documented descriptions.

## 5. Documentation Requirements

Each drift incident record must include:

- Summary of what was said.
- Why it conflicted with STEP Q documents.
- Who said it and in what role.
- Audience and distribution channel.
- Classification (Minor, Moderate, Severe).
- Containment and rollback actions taken.

These records are used in audits and training.

## 6. Escalation Paths

- Minor incidents:
  - Handled by the local manager and Language Reviewer.
- Moderate incidents:
  - Escalated to the relevant department head (Sales, Marketing, Product) and the Cognitive Governance contact.
- Severe incidents:
  - Escalated to executive leadership and governance.

## 7. Explicit Prohibitions During Drift Handling

During drift incident handling, the following are not acceptable responses:

- "We will clarify later" without taking immediate rollback or correction steps.
- "We did not mean it that way" without acknowledging inconsistency.
- "Customers understood us wrong" as the primary explanation.

The responsibility lies with the organization’s communication, not with user interpretation.
