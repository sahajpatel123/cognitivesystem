# Language Escalation Rules

This document defines when and how language about the system must be escalated for review. It does not modify the system.

## 1. Reference

Escalation rules are based on:

- `docs/LAUNCH_NARRATIVE.md`
- `docs/ANTI-ANTHROPOMORPHISM_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/DEMO_AND_SALES_BOUNDARIES.md`

## 2. Mandatory Escalation Triggers

Language must be escalated for review when any of the following appear in drafts, proposals, or conversations:

- Claims or implications that the system:
  - remembers users,
  - learns from users,
  - adapts to users,
  - personalizes responses,
  - has a personality or emotions,
  - improves itself over time based on usage.
- Comparisons to humans, colleagues, or teammates.
- Statements about future changes to how the system works without reference to governance.

## 3. Escalation Path

When a trigger is detected:

1. The person who noticed it (author, reviewer, manager) must stop approval or publication.
2. The language is sent to a designated Language Reviewer.
3. The Language Reviewer:
   - Compares the language with STEP Q documents.
   - Decides whether the language is allowed, must be reworked, or must be rejected.
4. The decision is recorded for audit (for example, in an internal log or ticket).

## 4. Who Can Escalate

- Any employee involved in:
  - writing copy,
  - reviewing materials,
  - preparing demos or talks,
  - handling customer communications.
- There are no role exemptions: anyone can and must escalate when triggers are seen.

## 5. What Escalation Blocks

When an escalation trigger is present:

- Publication of the material.
- Use of the script in demos or talks.
- Sending of the communication to customers.

No material with unresolved triggers may be used externally.

## 6. Violations

- If language with unresolved triggers is used externally, it is recorded as a drift incident.
- Repeated violations by the same team or role are flagged for additional oversight.
