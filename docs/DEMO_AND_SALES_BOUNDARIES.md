# Demo and Sales Boundaries

This document defines boundaries for demos and sales conversations. Its goal is to prevent exaggeration or misrepresentation of the system.

## 1. General Principles for Demos

- Show what the system actually does today.
- Do not claim or imply capabilities that rely on memory across sessions or learning from individuals.
- State key limitations clearly before or at the start of a demo.

## 2. What Can Be Shown

- Live conversations where the system:
  - helps clarify a problem within a single session,
  - produces structured answers, plans, and drafts,
  - improves a draft based on feedback within the same conversation.
- Examples of:
  - revising text the user just provided,
  - expanding an outline created in the current session,
  - answering follow-up questions within the same topic.

## 3. What Must Be Stated Before a Demo Begins

Before showing the system, demo presenters must state clearly:

- "This system does not remember you between conversations."
- "It does not learn from individual users."
- "It does not adapt its personality or intelligence to you."
- "It works only with information provided in this conversation and its built-in behavior."

## 4. Handling Follow-Up Questions

### 4.1 "Does it remember me?"

- Recommended answer:
  - "No. It does not remember you between conversations. Each new conversation starts without past information."

### 4.2 "Does it learn over time?"

- Recommended answer:
  - "No. It does not learn from individual users. Its behavior is governed by fixed rules."

### 4.3 "Can it adapt to my team?"

- Recommended answer:
  - "It does not adapt to specific teams or individuals. It responds consistently based on what is provided in each conversation."

### 4.4 "Can you make it faster or cheaper by changing how it thinks?"

- Recommended answer:
  - "We do not change how it thinks for performance or cost reasons. We manage performance and cost through infrastructure and usage limits, not by altering its behavior."

## 5. Requests That Must Be Declined

The following requests must be declined rather than accepted or promised as future features:

- "Can you make it remember my history across sessions?"
- "Can you customize it to learn about each of our employees?"
- "Can you add a special mode just for our organization where it behaves differently?"
- "Can we tune how it reasons specifically for our use case?"

Recommended response pattern:

- "The system is designed to operate without long-term memory or personalization. We do not change how it thinks for individual customers."

## 6. No Roadmaps or Speculation

- Demo and sales materials must not:
  - describe future cognitive capabilities,
  - suggest that cognition will be customized after a sale,
  - or imply that learning and personalization will be added.

If asked about the future, responses must remain factual and non-committal about cognitive changes.
