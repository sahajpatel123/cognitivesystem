# Phase 5 — Step 0: Expression Posture Framing

_Date: 2026-01-07_

## A. Purpose & Scope
Expression posture defines how the system externally stands toward the user while remaining grounded in prior cognition. Correct internal reasoning alone is insufficient for trust; external presentation must be governed so it neither overstates certainty nor collapses into informal drift. Posture is defined before any wording or interaction rules so later expression work inherits a stable stance without improvisation. This step introduces no behavior, templates, or phrasing.

---

## B. Definition of Expression Posture
Expression posture is the policy-governed communication stance that determines structural guardrails for what may be expressed (format tightness, restraint, explicitness of limits) without selecting language. It governs:
- Structural discipline (e.g., bounded formats vs. open form)
- Degree of restraint (minimality vs. expanded exposition)
- Explicitness of caveats and constraints when expression is permitted

Expression posture does **not** govern tone, verbosity preference, personality, persuasion, or stylistic choices. It is not the wording itself; it is the stance that precedes wording.

---

## C. Separation from Prior Concepts
- **Rigor (Phase 4)**: internal constraint density on reasoning; posture consumes its outputs but does not alter them.  
- **Friction (Phase 4)**: internal slowdown mechanisms; posture may reflect slower pacing needs but does not create or remove friction.  
- **Decision proximity, risk classification, irreversibility/horizon (Phase 4 Steps 1–3)**: upstream signals that inform whether posture should be tighter or looser; posture must not override or reinterpret these signals.  

Expression posture is derived from these inputs yet remains a distinct external-facing stance; it cannot reduce or relax upstream safeguards.

## D. Expression Posture Taxonomy (Ordered, Internal)
1. **Baseline Posture**  
   - Stance: default, structurally minimal expression with standard constraints.  
   - Permits: concise, necessity-bound expression aligned with upstream constraints; limited structural guardrails.  
   - Restricts: unnecessary elaboration or speculative expansion beyond what is required to answer minimally.
2. **Guarded Posture**  
   - Stance: elevated restraint with tighter structural bounds.  
   - Permits: structured expression that foregrounds constraints and limits; inclusion of explicit boundary markers when needed.  
   - Restricts: expansive exposition, implicit assumptions, or unbounded structure.
3. **Constrained Posture**  
   - Stance: maximal restraint; expression is tightly bounded and may be heavily structured or minimized.  
   - Permits: only narrowly scoped, structure-first expression that adheres strictly to upstream safeguards.  
   - Restricts: any elaboration or speculative content; optional elements are omitted unless required for safety.

No wording examples are defined here; ordering reflects increasing restraint and structural tightness.

## E. Failure Modes Prevented
- Casual expression in contexts requiring elevated caution.  
- Overly heavy expression in low-risk contexts that erodes usability.  
- Inconsistent communication stance across similar situations.  
- Leakage of internal cognition directly to users without structural framing.  
- Misusing verbosity or brevity as a proxy for safety.  

---

## F. Non-Goals (Mandatory)
- Does not choose words, phrasing, tone, or voice.  
- Does not design interaction flows or surface reasoning steps.  
- Does not override Phase 4 decisions or adjust rigor/friction.  
- Does not optimize engagement, friendliness, or persuasion.  
- Does not introduce heuristics, thresholds, scoring, or runtime logic.

## G. Stability & Closure Marker
Expression posture definitions are stable once closed. All later Phase 5 steps must conform to this vocabulary and ordering. Any change requires explicitly re-opening Phase 5 Step 0; ad-hoc modifications elsewhere are prohibited.
